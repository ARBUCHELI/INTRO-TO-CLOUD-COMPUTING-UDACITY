# INTRO-TO-CLOUD-COMPUTING-UDACITY

# LESSON 1

## 1. Meet your instructor 

### Ami Maloof
My name is Ami Mahloof and I am a senior cloud architect. My experience with cloud computing goes back to the early days of AWS, around 2008, when AWS used to have EC2 
and S3 services with very basic functionality. In my career, I've managed production workloads with millions of users, on multiple cloud providers: AWS, GCP, Azure, 
Alibaba Cloud, and Rackspace.

I've designed and built architectures for automatic scaling, high availability, machine learning, monitoring, and more. I've automated most of the cloud operations
programmatically and even extended some cloud services by myself.

I have over 10 years of experience with AWS. In this course, I will be teaching you to work with and integrate basic cloud services.

## Course Outline

In this course, we will cover:

* Overview of cloud computing, benefits, major providers, and cost management
* Cloud computing fundamentals, characteristics, and virtualization
* AWS console access, and AWS services
* Compute services
* Databases, and serverless architecture

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this course you will be able to:

* Navigate and interact with the AWS services in the console
* Create cloud identities and policies to access the cloud services
* Store files in an S3 bucket
* Launch a Linux Virtual Machine (AWS EC2 instance)
* Automate EC2 instance provisioning via an init script that will retrieve data from an S3 bucket
* Create a serverless app for storing users' names and greeting them when they return, using serverless architecture (API Gateway, Lambda, and a Redis database)

## Lesson Outline

This lesson covers the benefits of cloud computing, the major cloud providers currently, deployment model, and estimating costs for running services in the cloud.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Explain the benefits of cloud computing
* Differentiate between cloud service providers
* Choose when to use a public versus private deployment model
* Estimate cloud costs based on the AWS calculator

## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a collection of online managed services (especially data storage and computing power) owned, run, and maintained by a cloud provider, without direct active management from users. Pay for what you use.

### Users
Organizations of any type, size, or industry use cloud computing. For example:

* Mobile apps companies
* Websites
* Large organizations with extended IT services
* Video streaming platforms Netflix, Hulu, youtubeâ€¦
* Online video games
* Developers that need to work together in a shared environment

## Benefits of Cloud Computing


### Agility
The cloud is agile. Infrastructure resources can spin up when necessary. Among these resources are compute, storage, databases, Internet of things (IoT), machine learning, analytics, and more.

### Elasticity
The cloud has the ability to handle peak levels of business activity automatically and on-demand, by scaling resources up or down to shrink or grow capacity when the business needs change.

### Economy
Because cloud computing removes the traditional costs of owning and maintaining hardware, and payment is only for usage, the cost savings are very large. On top of that cloud computing providers offer steep discounts for some resources, such as compute, if the workflow on them can be interrupted. This even further increases the cost-savings of running in the cloud.

### Availability
Cloud computing providers offer their services in many locations within a geographical region, and in many locations around the globe. This extends the availability and durability of cloud services.

### QUIZ QUESTION
What are 3 benefits of cloud computing?

* Elasticty
* Economy
* Scalability
