# INTRO-TO-CLOUD-COMPUTING-UDACITY

# LESSON 1 OVERVIEW

## 1. Meet your instructor 

### Ami Maloof
My name is Ami Mahloof and I am a senior cloud architect. My experience with cloud computing goes back to the early days of AWS, around 2008, when AWS used to have EC2 
and S3 services with very basic functionality. In my career, I've managed production workloads with millions of users, on multiple cloud providers: AWS, GCP, Azure, 
Alibaba Cloud, and Rackspace.

I've designed and built architectures for automatic scaling, high availability, machine learning, monitoring, and more. I've automated most of the cloud operations
programmatically and even extended some cloud services by myself.

I have over 10 years of experience with AWS. In this course, I will be teaching you to work with and integrate basic cloud services.

## 2. Course Outline

In this course, we will cover:

* Overview of cloud computing, benefits, major providers, and cost management
* Cloud computing fundamentals, characteristics, and virtualization
* AWS console access, and AWS services
* Compute services
* Databases, and serverless architecture

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Explain the benefits of cloud computing
* Differentiate between cloud service providers
* Choose when to use a public versus private deployment model
* Estimate cloud costs based on the AWS calculator

## 4. Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a collection of online managed services (especially data storage and computing power) owned, run, and maintained by a cloud provider, without direct active management from users. Pay for what you use.

### Users
Organizations of any type, size, or industry use cloud computing. For example:

* Mobile apps companies
* Websites
* Large organizations with extended IT services
* Video streaming platforms Netflix, Hulu, youtubeâ€¦
* Online video games
* Developers that need to work together in a shared environment

### Agility
The cloud is agile. Infrastructure resources can spin up when necessary. Among these resources are compute, storage, databases, Internet of things (IoT), machine learning, analytics, and more.

### Elasticity
The cloud has the ability to handle peak levels of business activity automatically and on-demand, by scaling resources up or down to shrink or grow capacity when the business needs change.

### Economy
Because cloud computing removes the traditional costs of owning and maintaining hardware, and payment is only for usage, the cost savings are very large. On top of that cloud computing providers offer steep discounts for some resources, such as compute, if the workflow on them can be interrupted. This even further increases the cost-savings of running in the cloud.

### Availability
Cloud computing providers offer their services in many locations within a geographical region, and in many locations around the globe. This extends the availability and durability of cloud services.

### QUIZ QUESTION
What are 3 benefits of cloud computing?

* Elasticty
* Economy
* Scalability

## 6. Cloud History

In the early days of the Internet, before cloud computing, hosting providers allocated shared servers where one could run and install a monolithic app. This approach
encountered challenges to scalability and resiliency, as well as security risks.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/INTRO-TO-CLOUD-COMPUTING-UDACITY/master/images/2.jpg?token=ADDIJ7JF3HN6JR32CXKKTYDANB6E6)

Cloud computing became popular in 2006, when Amazon.com released its "Elastic Cloud Compute" service, known as EC2 ('E' for elastic and 2 'C's for Cloud Compute). Cloud computing addresses many of the challenges faced by early application platforms.

The word "cloud" has long been a metaphor for the Internet, and the cloud symbol was used in network telephony schematics all the way back to the 1970s.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/INTRO-TO-CLOUD-COMPUTING-UDACITY/master/images/3.jpg?token=ADDIJ7OFTLEIPQMVPSALQ7DANB6GK)

Since 2006, other cloud providers have surfaced. Additionally, many more services have been incorporated into the cloud, to minimize different self-managed services 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/INTRO-TO-CLOUD-COMPUTING-UDACITY/master/images/4.jpg?token=ADDIJ7KBXLO5VMZQ4G256LDANB6IK)

necessary to run different types of web applications.

### QUIZ QUESTION
In what year did cloud computing become popular?

* 2006

## 7. Cloud Stakeholders
The cloud matters to many few types of people in an organization:

* A CFO would be interested in budgets and costs for running in the cloud
* A developer would be interested in building an app or a platform in the cloud
* The IT department would be interested in centralizing, extending, and backing up on-premise data
* DevOps would be interested in improving uptime, responsiveness, and efficiency
* Marketing and Product Management would be interested in the analytics capabilities of the cloud

### Infrastructure as a service
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), also known as cloud infrastructure services, are highly scalable and automated computing resources.

IaaS is fully self-service for accessing and monitoring computers, networking, storage, and other services.

This model allows businesses to purchase resources on-demand and as-needed, instead of having to buy the hardware outright.

### IaaS Characteristics
* Resources are available as a service
* Cost varies depending on consumption
* Services are highly scalable
* Multiple users share a single piece of hardware
* Organization retain control of the infrastructure
* Dynamic and flexible

### Platform as a service (PaaS)
Platform as a service (PaaS), also known as cloud platform services, allows developers to build upon a framework to create custom applications. By obstructing or hiding servers, storage, and networking, PaaS providers help developers focus on managing their applications, rather managing the base infrastructure. Heroku is an example of a PaaS provider.

### PaaS Characteristics
* Builds on virtualization technology, so resources can easily be scaled up or down
* Provides a variety of services to assist with the development, testing, and deployment of apps
* Accessible to numerous users via the same development application
* Integrates web services and databases

### Software as a service (SaaS)
The most common option for cloud use, allowing 3rd-party vendors to deliver applications that run in the browser, without any installation. For example, G Suite is a SaaS solution for office apps in your browser.

### SaaS characteristics:
* Managed from a central location
* Hosted on a remote server
* Accessible in a browser (sometimes even when the user is offline)
* Users are not responsible for hardware or software updates

## 10. Deployment Models

### Cloud Deployment Models

### Public Deployment
The Public Deployment model is the most common deployment model. Services face the Internet and share hardware, network, and storage across many organizations and tenants.

### Advantages
* Cost-effective
* Pay-as-you-go - only pay for resources you use
* Maintenance-free - the cloud provider is responsible

### Private Deployment
The Private Deployment model limits each deployment to a single organization. This model provides better control of network security. Resources are not shared between organizations and tenants, which reduces risk.

The private cloud can be an on-premise or it can be hosted by a cloud provider. Even if the deployment is hosted by a cloud provider, all of the hardware and software is dedicated to one organization.

The Private Deployment model is often used by governments, financial institutions, or organizations that must comply with strict regulatory protocols

### Advantages
* Supports highly customized networks
* Facilitates tighter security and privacy
* Provides greater control over infrastructure

### Hybrid Deployment
The Hybrid Deployment model is a mix of the Public and Private Deployment models, combining the benefits of both.

This model offers the flexibility of running on private infrastructure, but the model can switch to the public cloud when permissible, to realize the benefits such as cost-savings.

In Hybrid Deployment data can flow from the private cloud to the public cloud and vice versa.

The downside of a hybrid deployment model is the cost of configuring and maintaining services across both types of clouds.

## 11. Quiz: Deployment Models

### QUESTION 1 OF 2
Which of the following is the most cost-effective deployment model?

* Public

### QUESTION 2 OF 2
Which network configuration would be typical of a private deployment model?

* 1 IP address: 10.0.0.20

## 12. Major Providers

### Major Cloud Providers
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure

At a high level, these providers are similar. However, there are many factors that distinguish them from each other, including:

* Geographic Availability
* Market Share and Growth Rate
* Services
* Pricing Model

### Geographic Availability
Cloud computing locations are worldwide. These locations called "regions" and "availability zones."

Each region is a separate geographic area. Within each region, there are multiple isolated locations known as availability zones.

This geographic spread provides the ability to place resources, such as compute and storage, closer to end-users for faster access and better performance.

The number of regions and the availability zones within them differs between cloud providers.

* AWS has 18 regions and between 2-6 availability zones per region
* GCP has 23 regions with at least 3 availability zones per region
* Azure has 58 regions worldwide and is available in 140 countries all around the world

The geographic locations between each cloud providers are different. One example is that currently the only cloud provider that can work in mainland China is AWS GCP offers a region in Hong Kong, but those resources are not always accessible from mainland China.

And there are other key factors such as submarine networking between geographic locations.
 
![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/June/5edc02ac_major-cloud-providers-geography/major-cloud-providers-geography.png)

### Market Share And Growth Rate
* AWS has been around since 2006 and is currently the leading cloud provider, with 33% market share
* Microsoft Azure holds about 17% worldwide market share
* Google has about 6% percent of the market worldwide

While this doesn't add up to 100%, remember that there are many other cloud providers that, in aggregate, make up the entire cloud computing market.

![](https://github.com/ARBUCHELI/INTRO-TO-CLOUD-COMPUTING-UDACITY/blob/master/images/8.jpg)

### Services
* AWS offers 200+ services, ranging from computing, storage, and databases through machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to Internet of Things (IoT), analytics, and more
* GCP offers about 50+ services, similar to AWS
* Azure offers about 30+ services, with a focus on integration with other Microsoft tools

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/INTRO-TO-CLOUD-COMPUTING-UDACITY/master/images/9.jpg?token=ADDIJ7O33QD26F7EU4SZR3DANDBLU)

### Pricing
The pricing models of the major cloud provides are similar:

* On-demand, pay-as-you-go
* Discounts for committed usage
* Usage-based serverless resources

On-demand pricing for the same compute (CPU-RAM-Disk) resources varies between cloud providers and is calculated on an hourly rate.

Discounts also vary between cloud providers. For example, AWS offers reserved instances that you can pre-purchase annually, whereas GCP offers "sustained use discount" whereby pricing goes down the more you use an instance.

Serverless computing (Lambda on AWS, Functions on Azure, and Cloud Functions on GCP) are billed for the compute power you use, based on 100-millisecond increments.

## 13. Quiz: Major Cloud Providers

### QUIZ QUESTION
What are the key factors distinguishing between the major cloud providers?

* Geographic Availability in Regions and Zones
* Pricing Models
* Services
* Market Shares and Growth Rate

## 14. Costs

### Costs In The Cloud
Cost savings is one of the reasons why companies are moving into the Cloud, but these costs can get out of hand easily.

Cloud providers supply up-to-date pricing information for all of their services and components.

Let's explore one way to estimate the costs for the infrastructure we need on AWS using the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/).

## 15. Quiz: Costs Overview

### Quiz: Costs
### QUESTION 1 OF 2
Which tool estimates a service's end-to-end costs?
* AWS Pricing Calculator

### QUESTION 2 OF 2
If the cost of a t2.medium is $0.04 per hour, approximately how much would it cost to run an instance for the whole month of January?
* $30

##  16. Exercise: AWS Pricing Calculator

In this exercise, you will use the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) to estimate the costs for a hypothetical upload and resize service hosted on AWS.

The service architecture is:

* Compute and storage run in the ```us-west-2 Oregon``` region
* One (1) EC2 ```t2.medium on-demand``` instance with a root volume of ```250GB```
* One (1) S3 bucket with a ```Standard``` storage class, which will store the resized images
* The size of the uploaded images will not exceed: ```200GB``` per month
* The resized image requires ```1MB``` of S3 storage
* The server disk space is cleaned up monthly

Factors you should take into account for the cost estimate:

* There is no charge for <strong>inbound data transfer</strong> across all services in all regions
* A write operation to S3 is known as a PUT request

### Expected Result
If your estimate is correct, your total monthly cost should be approximately <strong>64.47 USD.</strong>

## 17. Solution: AWS Pricing Calculator

Please open the link in a new tab to watch the tutorial:

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ARBUCHELI/INTRO-TO-CLOUD-COMPUTING-UDACITY/master/images/11.jpg?token=ADDIJ7MSCJKCV2OCL5DIPDLANDGIY)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMni87XTRbo&feature=emb_logo)

### Solution
The following is a solution for the AWS Pricing Calculator exercise.

We will first disaggregate the cloud services. Then we will configure the attributes of each service in the [AWS pricing calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/).

### Breakdown
The upload service is built on top of 2 cloud services:

* EC2 for compute
* S3 for cloud storage

Region for service: ```us-west-2 (Oregon)``` region

### EC2 Information We Know
* The EC2 instance payment model is ```on-demand```
* There is one EC2 instance of ```t2.medium``` type
* The size for root storage on the instance is ```250GB```

### S3 Information We Know
* The default storage class for S3 is ```standard``` which is what the service will use
* We will be storing ```200GB``` of images per month
* Each image stored on S3 will be 1MB
* A write operation in S3 is known as ```Put request```, so if we convert the 200GB to MB we should get 200,000MB (multiply the digital storage value by 1000)

### Walkthrough
### EC2 Cost Estimation
Open up the [AWS Pricing Calcuator](https://calculator.aws/#/)

Click on the <strong>Create estimate</strong> button

Type <strong>ec2</strong> in the <strong>AWS services</strong> filter box, then click on the <strong>configure</strong> button

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/April/5e84f9fb_ec2-configure/ec2-configure.png)

Change the ```Region``` dropdown to ```US West (Oregon)``` and leave the default option to create a Quick estimate.

Choose the option of ```Search instances by name``` and Enter ```t2.medium``` for the instance type

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/April/5e84f9f9_screen-shot-2020-04-01-at-12.17.23/screen-shot-2020-04-01-at-12.17.23.png)

Scroll down the ```Pricing strategy``` box and choose ```On-Demand instances```

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/April/5e850644_aws-calculator-ec2-pricing-strategy/aws-calculator-ec2-pricing-strategy.png)

Scroll down the ```Pricing strategy``` box and choose ```On-Demand instances```

Now let's configure the root size of the ```Elastic Block Storage (EBS)``` which is the disk connected to the instance.

The default is ```General Purpose SSD (gp2)``` which is what we want so we just need to change the ```Storage amount to 250GB```

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/April/5e850698_aws-calculator-ec2-ebs/aws-calculator-ec2-ebs.png)

At this point we can already tell that the EC2 would cost us $58.87 USD monthly, That's all we need for the EC2 section, so let's click the ```Add to my estimate``` button

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/April/5e85071c_aws-calculator-ec2-summry/aws-calculator-ec2-summry.png)

### Configure The S3 For The Service
Now that we have the estimate built for our compute section let's add to it the S3 storage service.

Click the ```Add service``` button to add a new service, then type ```s3``` in the AWS services filter box, notice how other services that use S3 also coming up in the search as the filter look up the description too.

scroll down and look for the actual service, S3 is called ```Simple Storage Service``` these 3 Initials are all starting with the letter S which is 3S => S3

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/April/5e8507cb_aws-calculator-s3-intro/aws-calculator-s3-intro.png)

Click on the ```Configure``` button on the ```Amazon Simple Storage Service``` button to configure the S3 service.

Make sure the region is set to ```US West (Oregon)```

un-toggle all of the Storage classes but the ```S3 Standard``` as well as the ```Data Transfer``` as we are not going to pull data from S3 and all Incoming traffic is free.

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/April/5e8507ca_aws-calculator-s3-storage-class/aws-calculator-s3-storage-class.png)

We know that the service will be uploading 200GB per month of images so let's configure the storage amount to 200GB per month

and under the ```PUT, COPY, POST, LIST requests to S3 standard``` type 200,000

scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the ```Add to my estimate``` button

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/April/5e8507c9_aws-calculator-s3-storage/aws-calculator-s3-storage.png)

Your S3 cost should come up to somewhere around <strong>$5.60 USD</strong>

![](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/April/5e8507c8_aws-calculator-s3-summary/aws-calculator-s3-summary.png)

Your Estimate should come up to somewhere around <strong>$64.47 USD</strong>

Please keep in mind that pricing always changes and is dynamic.

## 18. Edge Cases

### When Not to Use The Cloud
There are situation in which the costs of running in the cloud surpass the costs of running and maintaining a set of servers.

One example is GPU machine learning. While the cloud can provide cost optimization for GPU instances via spot instance discounts, often the cost of running a set of cloud GPU instances would be much higher than the cost to buy and maintain your own set of GPU servers.

Other examples include the Private deployment model, which might be on-premise for security or regulatory reasons.

Even though the cloud has many managed services, cloud applications still require an experienced engineer with security, networking, and cloud skills to maintain the application. If an organization lacks such a person, the cloud might not be a good option.

### QUIZ QUESTION
When should you avoid the cloud?

* When regulations or company policy prohibit you from running in a multi-tenant environment
* When you lack the expertise to utilize cloud services

## 19. Intuition

### Intuition
Even though this course is aimed at beginners, we will nonetheless study security, networking, and best practices. In my experience working alongside many beginners, their focus was, "First let's just get it working," without thinking about security or designing a network for their needs. The results were problematic since the work had to be redone.

In this course, you'll learn to work with cloud resources the "right" way.
